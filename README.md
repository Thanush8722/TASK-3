Task-3
ðŸ“Œ Project Title Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using Deep Learning and Flask

ðŸŽ¯ Objective To build a deep learning model that can classify images as cats or dogs, and deploy it as a web application using Flask.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Python, PyTorch, Torchvision Pretrained ResNet18 model Flask (for web interface) ImageFolder dataset format

ðŸ§ª What I Did Collected and organized a dataset of cat and dog images Applied image transforms like resizing, flipping, and rotation Used a ResNet18 model, fine-tuned on the dataset Handled class imbalance using weighted loss Trained the model for 30 epochs with high accuracy Created a Flask app where users can upload images and get predictions

âœ… Result The model predicts cats and dogs accurately A working web app allows users to test it easily I learned how to train models, handle data, and deploy them using Flask
